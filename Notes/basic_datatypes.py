    .insert(1, "chocolate")             to add a value at a specific position
    .pop(INX)                           to remove value using index value
    .remove("anything")                 to remove a value using value itself

# TUPLES

Tuples = \
"""
Methods:
    tuple(list)     to convert list to tuple
    .count()        to count the value in the tuple
    .index()        to give the index of the value
    .sort()         to sort the tuple
    .reverse()      to copy original tuple to new tuple
    .del()          to delete whole tuple
    .copy()         to copy whole tuple


--> Note :  We can concatenate tuples other operations are not allowed

    tuple is an immutable object...it takes less space than list and also less time to run.
    tuple helps us when handling large data bases by python
