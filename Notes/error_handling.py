Error Handling:
    We can reduce Most of the errors by error handling one of the common error handlers are try/except

    try:
        ur code block                   # try executing code
    except <error>:
        do the necessary things          # if "try" code causes error instead of raising it do this code

    Note : if you don't specify <error> in except then it will consider all errors for it
